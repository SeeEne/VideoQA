# Configuration for BOTH embedding extraction AND probe training

ProbeTraining:
  # --- Shared ---
  PROBING_DATASET_NAME: "EuroSAT"
  VISION_MODEL_ID: "facebook/dinov2-base" # Model for both extraction & probing ID
  # Base path where <EMBEDDING_BASE_PATH>/<MODEL_ID_safe>/ embeddings are stored/saved
  EMBEDDING_BASE_PATH: "../embeddings/precomputed_embeddings_euroSAT" # Base path for embeddings

  # --- For Embedding Extraction (extract_embeddings.py) ---
  DATASET_PATH: "../dataset/EuroSAT" # Path to ImageFolder root (needs train/val subdirs)
  IMAGE_SIZE: 224             # Input image size for vision model
  EXTRACTION_BATCH_SIZE: 64   # Batch size for running vision model (adjust based on VRAM)
  EXTRACTION_NUM_WORKERS: 4   # Workers for loading images during extraction

  # --- For Probe Training (main.py) ---
  # EMBEDDING_DIM: # Removed - Determined from loaded embeddings
  # NUM_CLASSES:   # Removed - Determined from loaded labels/dataset
  PROBE_TYPE: "linear"
  EPOCHS: 25
  PROBE_BATCH_SIZE: 128 # Can often be larger than extraction batch size
  LEARNING_RATE: 0.001
  OPTIMIZER: "Adam"
  PROBE_NUM_WORKERS: 4 # Workers for loading embeddings (often 0 is fine)
  OUTPUT_DIR_PROBE_BASE: "../results/probe_results_euroSAT" # Base directory for saving probe results

# --- Optional: Add Experiment or other sections if needed by data_preprocess ---
# Experiment:
#   LPIPS_NET_TYPE: "vgg" # Example: Still needed if LPIPS is used elsewhere maybe?
